The essential plugin for every multisite install! Manage plugin access permissions across your entire multisite network.

== Description ==
Plugin management for Wordpress Multisite that supports the native plugins page and the WPMU DEV Pro Sites plugin! Used on thousands of multisite installs across the web.
Previously known as **WPMU Plugin Manager**, it uses a backend options page to adjust plugin permissions for all the sites in your network.

* Select what plugins sites have access to
* Choose plugins to Auto-Activate for all new blogs
* Mass activate/deactivate a plugin on all sites in your network (Very Handy!)
* Assign special plugin access permissions for specific sites in your network
* And as Super Admin, you can override all these to activate specific plugins on the sites you choose!
* Removes the plugin meta row links (Version, Author, Plugin) and any update messages for blog admins

Also, if you use the excellent <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/pro-sites/">Pro Sites plugin from WPMU DEV</a> you will be able to charge for access to certain plugins!
